# Udacity AI Nanodegree development environment

I built this small starter for the Udacity AI nanodegree program. Rather than installing Python on your machine, if you have Docker installer, you can just clone this repo, open it in VS Code and it will automatically install everything that you need to run a full Python environment in a container, keeping your host system clean.

> See more info [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-try-a-dev-container) on using Dev Containers.

This project does require the `ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers` extension to work.

After opening this in VS Code, You can clone the projects repository into the root of this folder to work on your projects.
